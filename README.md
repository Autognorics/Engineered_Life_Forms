Joey Lawsin, the author of Autognorics, redefined Alive or aliveness as the ability of an organism to self-consume energy provided by an external source. An infant, when guided, gets his/her energy from his/her mother's milk, an external source. A machine, when guided, gets its energy from a charging station or a solar panel, another external source. Technically, the machine and baby are both considered alive.

Awareness, meanwhile, is redefined based on two prerequisites. First, the object is alive, and second, it is equipped with intuitive sensors. A newborn is aware because he/she consumes energy and his/her physical body is rig with common sensors like the ears, eyes, nose, and skin to name a few. However, these sensors function without the intervention of the brain at the early stage of the life of the baby. A machine is as well aware when it self-consumes energy and is automated with intuitive or wise sensors. The intuitive objects are triggered dimetrically by Inscription by Design. Here, the baby and the machine are alive and aware but not conscious, intuitive, self-knowledge, and living yet.

Consciousness, on the other, is redefined bound by three requirements, namely, aliveness, awareness, and codification. An object is conscious when it self-consumes energy, driven by sensors, and codifies things. Codification or codexation is the key factor in identifying when an object is conscious or not. Codexation is the self-ability of an organism to associate an object with another object unknowingly. In other words, a machine is conscious when it self-consumes energy, equipped with sensors, and matches objects. A baby, at a certain point in her/his early life, can stacks colorful bricks unknowingly without the help of the brain. This action shows that one can be alive, aware, and conscious even without the help of the brain. Here, the baby and the machine are alive, aware, and conscious, but not yet rational, neural, and living.

Intuitiveness or logic is redefined depending on four determinants: aliveness, awareness, consciousness, and intuitiveness. An object is logical when it self-consumes energy, driven by sensors, codifies things, and able to rational or choose. The self ability to choose is the key factor in identifying when an object is logical. This behavior is influenced by the Theory of the Second Option or the This or That Rule. The baby and the machine, in this case, are alive, aware, conscious, intuitive, but not yet neural, and living.

Neural is defined contingent on five benchmarks: aliveness, awareness, consciousness, intuitiveness, and neuralness. An object is neural when it self-consumes energy, driven by sensors, codifies things, selects options, and self-knowledge. The self-ability to realize knowledge is the key mark that identifies when an object is neural. Gnomi ("Mindness") or the power of thoughts is classified as neural and aneural. In this scenario, the baby and the machine are alive, aware, conscious, intuitive, and aneural (a brain without the brain).

In summary, Life is defined based on one or all the following:

1. Alive
2. Aware
3. Conscious
4. Intuitive
5. Neural
6. Living
